# Bank Recognizer
This should be a simple interface where you can enter a bank name as you know it, and you'd get the official name. e.g. Access -> Access Bank Plc, Providus -> Providus Bank, Skye -> Polaris Bank etc.

## Problem 
I recently needed to get banks' official names from users' input. Turns out there's no concrete way to do this without some sort of natural language processing/machine learning. Using Regex (Or at least my knowledge) of it is limited.
